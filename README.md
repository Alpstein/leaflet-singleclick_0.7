# singleclick for Leaflet 0.7.*

This plugin extends `L.Map` to fire the `singleclick` event. The `singleclick` event is not part of Leaflet's core, and most likely never will be: [#108](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/108)



Note: For Leaflet 0.8 it could be possible to extend `L.Evented` instead, to have also Marker etc. support the `singleclick` event.
